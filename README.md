# SpectralAnalysisOfAudioSignals
Typical human speech ranges between 50 Hz and 300 Hz. Most men typically range between 85-180Hz, and most women between 165-255Hz. If we look at a spectrum of audio for English speakers, we get a pretty substantial diï¬€erence between the genders. This is of course not super surprising to anyone with a pair of ears.
In this project, I implemented a simple technique that is based on pick frequencies in male/female power spectrums.
